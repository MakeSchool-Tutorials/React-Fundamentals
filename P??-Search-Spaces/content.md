## Searching Spaces

Imagine you wanted to search spaces by typing the address into a input and showing all spaces in our JSON file that matched. 

To do this you will need to create an input and handle the text entered. React has a special pattern for this called the controlled component pattern. 

The controlled component pattern is built around state. State is a value stored inside of a component that the component tracks. Changes to state cause the component to Render. The idea is that somethings that change need to be reflected in the appearance of a component.
